WHAT IS IT?

A scientific calculator, supporting
   - the usual trigonometric, etc., functions
   - your choice of algebraic or Reverse Polish notation
   - your choice of real or complex arithmetic
   - binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal
   - four memory cells
   - the first few elements of the calculation stack are visible.


INSTALLATION

There are no special installation requirements.  Just unzip this
package into a directory of your choice.  If you don't like the
program, delete that directory.  System files such as CONFIG.SYS
are not affected.


ANSWERS TO SOME QUESTIONS

Q. Where are the pushbuttons?
A. On your keyboard.  I like keyboards.  I don't like mice.  If you
   want to do mouse clicks, get some other program.

Q. But I LIKE clicking on buttons.
A. Then you have the wrong program.  Go to http://hobbes.nmsu.edu.
   Go directly to Hobbes.  Do not pass Go.  Do not collect $200.
   You'll find some other calculators there.

Q. Where are the functions?
A. Try tapping on the Ctrl key.

Q. I don't like your colour scheme.
A. Open your System Setup folder, open the Mixed Colour Palette,
   use the right mouse key to drag a colour to the calculator.
   Hold down the shift key while dragging if you want to change
   a foreground colour.  While you're at it, open the Font
   Palette and start dragging from it too.  If you get confused,
   delete KeyCalc.INI and you'll get back the default fonts
   and colours.

Q. How do I enter a complex number?
A. Use a comma as the separator.  For example, to enter the
   number that mathematicians usually write as "5+3i", type
   "5,3".  (Of course, this will work only if you have the
   calculator in Complex mode.)  You can also enter a complex
   number in polar notation, for example "58.3<-30", but
   check first whether you have chosen degrees or radians as
   your angle unit.
